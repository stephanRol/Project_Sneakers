        "The Nike Dunk Low TD ‘Georgetown’ showcases a two-tone palette inspired by the Hoyas. The leather upper is rendered in a light grey base with contrasting overlays in Dark Obsidian. No-tie elastic laces allow little feet to easily slip in and out of the shoe, while perforated detailing at the toe box yields enhanced breathability. Standard Nike branding on the heel tab and woven tongue tag project an OG aesthetic. The low-top is anchored by a rubber cupsole that pairs white sidewalls with a dark navy outsole.",

A lone pop of contrasting color is revealed inside the shoe, via Nike branding stamped in Total Orange on the sockliner. The low-top rests on a traditional rubber cupsole, featuring clean white sidewalls with a dark navy rubber outsole.",

This pair pays tribute to Sam Neill’s heroic paleontologist, featuring a beige suede upper with tonal textured leather on the heel tab and forefoot overlay. A red paisley print on the interior lining signifies the character’s signature bandana. A dinosaur-eye graphic adorns the tongue, while a Jurassic Park logo on the lateral side appears to ripped apart by a raptor claw. Underfoot, a rubber outsole in powder blue delivers a pastel pop of color.",
