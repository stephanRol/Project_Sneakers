The retro hoops shoe employs a leather upper that pairs a light grey base with contrasting overlays in Dark Obsidian. A lone pop of contrasting color is revealed inside the shoe, via Nike branding stamped in Total Orange on the sockliner. The low-top rests on a traditional rubber cupsole, featuring clean white sidewalls with a dark navy rubber outsole.",
